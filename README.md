###Front-end development baked in [Fire.app](http://fireapp.kkbox.com/ "Get Fire.app Here!")

*"I like baked potatoes. I don't have a microwave oven, and it takes forever to bake a potato in a conventional oven. Sometimes I'll just throw one in there, even if I don't want one, because by the time it's done, who knows? " -Hedberg*
